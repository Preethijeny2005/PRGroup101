poc_presence_poison.py

Purpose:
 - Demonstrates a presence-poisoning exploit where the server accepts a USER_ADVERTISE
   frame without checking the identity of the connection that sent it. The attacker
   can therefore make the server believe the victim is located at the attacker's host.

High-level exploit flow:
 1. A server maintains a mapping `user_locations` that says where to route messages
    for each user_id (e.g., 'victim_user' -> '10.0.0.5:9000').
 2. Vulnerable handler `handle_user_advertise` trusts incoming advertise frames and writes:
       user_locations[user_id] = host
    without verifying the sending connection is authenticated as that user (or that the
    advertise frame is signed by the user).
 3. An attacker sends a USER_ADVERTISE claiming to be 'victim_user' with host '127.0.0.1:9999'.
 4. The server overwrites the mapping and will now route messages for 'victim_user' to attacker host.

How to run:
  python poc_presence_poison.py

Expected output (key lines):
 - initial user_locations: {'victim_user': '10.0.0.5:9000'}
 - Received USER_ADVERTISE ... conn_auth=None
 - user_locations updated: {'victim_user': '127.0.0.1:9999'}
 - route: Message to victim_user would be routed to 127.0.0.1:9999 (attacker)

Mitigation summary:
 - Bind USER_ADVERTISE acceptance to the authenticated session identity (only accept advertise from the
   connection authenticated as that user), OR
 - Require USER_ADVERTISE frames to be signed by the user's private key and verify the signature + timestamp.
